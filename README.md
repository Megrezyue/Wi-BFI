# Wi-BFI

This is the implementation of the paper [Wi-BFI: Extracting the IEEE 802.11 Beamforming Feedback Information from Commercial Wi-Fi Devices](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3615453.3616514).

<br/>

### Wi-BFI is the first open source tool to retrieving Wi-Fi beamforming feedback angles (BFAs) and reconstruct beamforming feedback information (BFI) in the form of Vmatrices 
<br/>

<br/>

First, clone the repository with ``` git@github.com:kfoysalhaque/Wi-BFI.git ``` and move into the directory with ``` cd  Wi-BFI ```

Then, Setup the conda environment with ``` conda env create -f wi-bfi.yml ```

You might also want to install packages like tshark, wireshark, and airmon-ng

```
sudo apt-get install tshark wireshark aircrack-ng

```

## Wi-BFI Usage
<br/>
<strong>Extract BFAs and reconstruct Vmatrices from traces:</strong> If you already have the captured traces of the network (IEEE 802.11ac or 11ax), execute ``` main.py``` with a few arguments like the following:

<br/>

```
python main.py <'file name'> <'standard'>  <'mimo'>  <'antenna-config'>  <'bandwidth'>  <'mac address'>  <'no packet to process'>  <'file to save Vmatrices'>  <'file to save BFAs'>

```

<br/>
Example: 

```
python main.py 11ax_SU_4x2_160.pcapng  AX  SU  4x2  160  20:c1:9b:fe:4f:ed  200  V_ax_su_4x2_160  bfa_ax_su_4x2_160

```

<br/>

Options for these arguments are noted here:

<br/>

```
<'file name'>: name of the trace

<'standard'>: 'AC' / 'AX'

**<'mimo'>**: 'SU' / 'MU'

<'antenna-config'>: '3x1' (with IEEE 802.11ac) / '4x2' (with IEEE 802.11ax)
  *we will keep adding different other configurations with both AC and AX*

<'bandwidth'>: '160' *(for AX only)* / '80'/ '40' / '20' *(for AX and AC)*

<'mac address'>: MAC address of the Beamformee of which you want to extract the BFAs and Vmatrices.

<'no packet to process'>: The number of packets that you want to process. *(Should be equal/less than the number of available packets in the trace with the pre-defined MAC address )*

<'file to save Vmatrices'>: Name of the file where you want to save the vmatrices

<'file to save BFAs'>: Name of the file where you want to save the BFAs

```
